/*

Radix - the base of the number system. Eg: radix of integers is 10, radix of binary is 2
Width - the number of digits used to represent a number. Eg: width of 5000 is 4, width of 4EF3A is 5

Radix sort assumes that the radix and width of the numbers to be sorted is the same
This means we can sort int and String
